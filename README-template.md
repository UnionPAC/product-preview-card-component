### ðŸ¤“ What I learned

On the surface, this a very easy challenge, but there was a lot of opportunity to go deeper in certain aspects which could make the project better. Some of these included:

- Making accessible HTML content for screen-readers only

```html
<div class="product-price-container">
  <p class="sale-price"><span class="sr-only">Sale Price: </span>$149.99</p>
  <p class="original-price">
    <span class="sr-only">Original Price: </span>$169.99
  </p>
</div>
```

```css
/* Screen Reader: Hide content, but show for screenreader (to add context) */

.sr-only:not(:focus):not(:active) {
  clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0);
  clip-path: inset(50%);
  height: 1px;
  overflow: hidden;
  position: absolute;
  white-space: nowrap;
  width: 1px;
}
```

- Making use of HTML Data attributes (used later to grab CSS elements)

```html
<button class="btn" data-icon="shopping-cart">Add to Cart</button>
```

- Using CSS Psuedo elements (used to put shopping cart icon in button)

```css
.btn[data-icon="shopping-cart"]::before {
  content: "";
  background-image: url("./images/icon-cart.svg");
  width: 15px;
  height: 16px;
}
```

- Making use of the HTML `<picture>` tag in order to handle the image change going from mobile to deskop versions.

```html
<picture class="product-image">
  <source media="(min-width:600px)" srcset="images/image-product-desktop.jpg" />
  <img
    src="images/image-product-mobile.jpg"
    alt="Perfume Bottle laying on a white table with leaves above and below it."
  />
</picture>
```
